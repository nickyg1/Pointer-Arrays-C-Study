# Pointer-Arrays-C-Study

After completing Project One for GIOS I noted that I struggled with pointers. I found this book https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/readings/pointers.pdf after browsing reddit while looking for suggestions. The goal of this repo is to track my progress while I master pointers and become a more proficient C developer.
